- Practice clearing a session
- Practice having the server use data submitted by a client with a form

## Tasks

- [ ] Create a new Flask project called great_number_game

- [ ] In the root route, save a random number between 1 and 100 and display a form for the user to guess the number

- [ ] Create a route that determines whether the number submitted is too high, too low, or correct. Show this status on the HTML page.

- [ ] NINJA BONUS: Display the results as shown in the wireframe above (i.e. with appropriate colors and positioning)

- [ ] NINJA BONUS: Allow the user to keep guessing until they get it correct

- [ ] NINJA BONUS: Let the user know how many attempts they took before guessing the correct number

- [ ] SENSEI BONUS: Only allow the user to guess up to 5 times. If they don't guess it on their 5th attempt, display a "You Lose" message and allow them to try again.

- [ ] SENSEI BONUS: If they win, allow the user to submit their name. Have a link to a leaderboard page that shows winners' names and how many attempts they took to guess correctly.
